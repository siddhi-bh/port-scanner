# 🔍 Python Port Scanner

Hi! This is a simple TCP port scanner I built using Python. 
It's designed to scan a range of ports on any domain or IP address and tell you which ones are open.

I created this as part of my cybersecurity learning journey to understand how port scanning works and how attackers might probe networks.
The scanner uses sockets and threading to speed up the scanning process.

## 🚀 How to Use It

### Run from command line:
```bash
python scanner.py scanme.nmap.org 20 100
